## 1. Create a Wish + First Contribution
### Trigger
A user encounters a problem that feels unresolved and persistent. It may be local and specific, or broad and national. They have likely complained about it before, ignored it, or accepted it as “how things are.” What brings them to JanPulse is not optimism, but frustration mixed with a small hope that this time their concern might be taken seriously.
### User Intent
The user wants to express a concern in a way that matters. They are not trying to write a perfect proposal or start a campaign. They want to say, “This problem exists, and it matters enough to me that I am willing to put money behind it.” Implicitly, they expect the system to treat this intent seriously and not as noise.
### Entry into the System
Upon opening JanPulse, the user is presented with a simple input area to describe their wish. The system does not demand structure or polish. The user types freely, using their own words. They may optionally select a geographic scope, indicating whether the issue is local, regional, or national.

At this moment, the system makes its first promise: expression is easy, but it is not free.
### Attaching Commitment
Before the wish can be submitted, the user is asked to attach an amount. The minimum is ₹1, but the user can choose to contribute more. The interface makes it clear that this amount is not a fee or a donation in the traditional sense. It is a signal of intent. The system reinforces that the wish will only exist because the user is willing to stand behind it financially.

This is the first moment of hesitation. The user pauses. They consider whether the wish is truly worth ₹1. That pause is intentional. If the user proceeds, the system has already filtered casual expression.
### Payment and Irreversibility
The user confirms the amount and is redirected to the UPI payment flow. This moment is irreversible. Once the payment is completed, the money leaves the user’s account. JanPulse does not intercept or alter this transaction. It only receives confirmation that the payment has succeeded.

This is the second promise the system makes: money is handled outside of influence.
### Wish Formation and Normalization
After payment confirmation, the system processes the submitted text. The Wish Engine analyses the wish to determine whether a similar wish already exists. If a match is found, the system does not create a duplicate. Instead, it adds the contribution to the existing wish. If no match exists, a new wish is created and assigned a unique identifier.

Crucially, the user does not feel rejected or overwritten. Whether their wish is merged or newly created, their contribution visibly strengthens a public record.
### Ledger Entry and Visibility
At this point, the wish and the associated contribution are written to the Public Ledger. From this moment forward, the wish exists independently of the user. It has a visible total amount, a contributor count, and a geographic scope. The system makes no attempt to personalize or hide this information.

The user is shown confirmation that their wish now exists in the system, along with its current standing.
### Outcome and Trust Effect
The flow ends with the user seeing their concern transformed into a public, measurable signal. The wish is no longer private frustration. It is now part of a collective priority map.

The user’s trust in the system is shaped by three things:

* Their expression was easy but not free
* Their money moved transparently
* Their intent resulted in something visible and persistent

At the end of this flow, the user may not yet believe the problem will be solved. But they believe that their ₹1 mattered. That belief is the foundation upon which all future participation is built.

## 2. Wish Normalization & Aggregation
### Trigger
A user submits a wish and completes their contribution, or browses existing wishes and notices that many concerns sound similar but are phrased differently. This flow is often invisible at first, but its effects are immediately felt across the system.

### System Intent
The system’s responsibility is not to judge the value of a wish, but to understand its meaning. JanPulse must ensure that collective intent is not fragmented by language, phrasing, or individual expression styles. The goal is to allow many voices to strengthen a single priority rather than compete against each other.

### Initial Interpretation
When a wish enters the system, the Wish Engine analyses the text and associated context, including location and scope. It looks for semantic similarity with existing wishes rather than exact matches. Differences in wording, tone, or detail are treated as variations of expression, not separate problems.

At this stage, the system makes no decision that affects visibility or priority. It is only attempting to understand what the user is referring to.

### Aggregation Decision
If the system determines that a similar wish already exists, it does not reject the new wish. Instead, it treats the new submission as additional support for the existing one. The contribution is added to the existing wish’s total, and the contributor count increases accordingly.

If no sufficiently similar wish exists, a new wish is created and recorded as a distinct public entry.

This decision is deterministic and rule-based. The system does not optimize for popularity, clarity, or emotional impact. It optimizes for alignment of intent.

### User-Visible Outcome
From the user’s perspective, the result is clear and respectful. They see that their contribution has strengthened a visible public wish. If their wish was merged, they are shown the existing wish and its current standing. If a new wish was created, they see it appear in the system with their contribution attached.

At no point does the user feel corrected, overridden, or ignored. Their intent survives the process intact, even if their wording does not.

### Impact on Collective Priority
As aggregation occurs over time, wishes grow stronger rather than multiplying endlessly. The system’s ranking reflects concentration of concern rather than volume of text. This allows genuine public priorities to rise naturally without editorial intervention.

Users browsing the platform experience clarity instead of fragmentation. They see fewer, stronger wishes rather than many weak duplicates.

### Ledger Confirmation
Whether merged or newly created, the outcome of normalization is recorded in the public ledger. Contributions remain traceable. The history of how a wish accumulated support is preserved. Aggregation never erases evidence of participation.

### Outcome and Trust Effect
This flow ends without fanfare. Most users do not consciously notice it, and that is intentional. What they do notice is that the platform feels coherent, fair, and resistant to manipulation.

Trust is built through:

* respect for individual expression
* protection of collective strength
* absence of arbitrary judgment

At the end of this flow, users understand something quietly important: JanPulse listens to what people mean, not just what they say.

## 3. Discover & Fund an Existing Wish

### Trigger
A user opens JanPulse without a specific wish in mind. They may be curious, sceptical, or simply exploring. They want to understand what others care about and whether the platform reflects real problems or just noise. This is often the first time the user evaluates JanPulse as a collective system rather than a personal outlet.

### User Intent
The user wants to see what matters right now. Implicitly, they are asking: “Is this platform real? Are people actually using it? Does it reflect concerns like mine?” If they find something that resonates, they may be willing to contribute, but only if they believe their money will join something meaningful.

### Encountering Collective Priorities
On the home screen, the user is presented with a ranked list of wishes. Each wish displays its core description, geographic scope, total amount collected, and number of contributors. The ranking is not editorial or curated; it is visibly derived from collective backing.

This is the first critical trust moment. The user scans the list looking for signs of manipulation, artificial inflation, or irrelevance. The system’s restraint here is intentional: it explains rankings simply and avoids persuasive language.

### Selection and Recognition
The user taps on a wish that aligns with their concern or curiosity. On the wish detail view, they see the full description, contribution history, and current status. They recognize that others have already committed money to this issue. Their individual concern is no longer isolated.

At this point, the user experiences social proof, not through comments or likes, but through visible financial commitment.

### Decision to Participate
The system invites the user to contribute to the wish. The minimum amount is clearly stated, along with the option to give more. The language reinforces that this contribution will increase the wish’s priority and visibility, not merely its funding total.

This is the hesitation point. The user asks themselves whether this issue is worth supporting and whether the system deserves trust. The presence of existing contributors lowers the emotional risk of participation.

### Payment and Commitment
The user confirms the amount and completes the UPI payment flow. As with wish creation, this step is irreversible. JanPulse does not control the transaction; it only receives confirmation.

Once payment succeeds, the contribution is added to the wish’s total and contributor count.

### Collective Reinforcement
The user immediately sees the effect of their contribution. Totals update. Rankings may shift. The system visually reinforces that their action had an impact, however small.

The wish now feels more real, more alive, because they are part of it.

### Outcome and Trust Effect
This flow ends with the user experiencing alignment rather than expression. They did not need to explain or persuade; they simply joined a collective signal.

Trust is strengthened through:

* visible aggregation of intent
* immediate feedback after contribution
* clarity about where their money went

The user leaves this flow with a subtle but important shift in mindset. JanPulse is no longer a place where people complain. It is a place where priorities form. And they are now part of that process.

## 4. View Wish Details & Public Ledger

### Trigger
A user encounters a wish that interests them or one they have already contributed to. Curiosity shifts into scrutiny. They are no longer asking, “Do I like this idea?” but “Is this system honest?” This flow is often triggered by doubt, not enthusiasm.

### User Intent
The user wants to verify reality. They want to see whether the numbers add up, whether contributions are real, and whether the platform is hiding anything. Implicitly, they are testing the system’s claims of transparency and accountability.

### Entering the Wish Detail View
The user opens a wish. The system presents the full description, geographic scope, total amount collected, contributor count, and current status. The information is presented plainly, without promotional language or emotional framing.

At this point, the system makes a quiet promise: nothing important is hidden.

### Accessing the Public Ledger
The user is given access to the public ledger view associated with the wish. This ledger shows a chronological record of contributions, status changes, and execution updates. Each entry is timestamped and immutable.

Crucially, the ledger is not presented as a secondary feature. It is treated as the primary source of truth. Totals and summaries elsewhere in the interface visibly derive from it.

### Verification and Consistency
The user scans the ledger entries. They check whether:

* totals match individual contributions
* contributor counts align with history
* status changes are documented

This is a moment of intense cognitive evaluation. Any inconsistency would immediately undermine trust.

The system does not attempt to explain away complexity. It relies on consistency to speak for itself.

### Understanding System Boundaries
The ledger makes clear what JanPulse can and cannot do. Contributions are recorded, not edited. Past entries cannot be altered. Status changes are visible and attributable to specific moments in time.

The user realizes that even the platform is constrained by the ledger. This is a critical psychological shift: power appears limited rather than absolute.

### Contextual Clarity
Alongside the ledger, the system provides simple explanations of what different statuses mean and what has or has not yet happened. There is no attempt to reassure through messaging; clarity replaces persuasion.

### Outcome and Trust Effect
The flow ends with the user feeling oriented rather than convinced. They may still have doubts about whether the wish will be fulfilled, but they no longer doubt that the system is telling the truth about its current state.

Trust is built not through promises, but through:

* visible records
* internal consistency
* clear limits on power

At the end of this flow, the user understands that JanPulse does not ask them to believe in people. It asks them to verify a process.

That understanding is the foundation of durable trust.

## 5. Wish Moves into Execution

### Trigger
A wish reaches a defined threshold of collective backing. This threshold is not framed as success or completion; it is framed as readiness. Enough people have attached money to the same concern that inaction is no longer acceptable.

For users who have contributed, this moment often arrives quietly. There is no notification of victory, only a visible shift in status.

### System Intent
The system’s responsibility at this stage is to convert accumulated intent into obligation. Until now, JanPulse has recorded, aggregated, and exposed public priorities. At this point, the system must clearly and publicly assign responsibility for action.

This transition is not symbolic. It is operational.

### Status Transition
The wish’s status changes from “open” or “funded” to “in execution.” This change is timestamped and recorded in the public ledger. The system makes it explicit that the wish has crossed from expression into action.

Nothing else changes visually at first. There is no celebration, no countdown, no promise of speed. The restraint is deliberate.

### Assignment of Responsibility
Behind the scenes, the wish is formally handed to the JanPulse Organization. This handoff is not invisible. The ledger records that execution responsibility has been assumed by the organization, along with the initial allocation of funds and scope definition.

From this moment forward, the wish is no longer abstract. It has an owner.

### Visibility to Contributors
When contributors view the wish, they can see that execution has begun. They can also see what this means in practical terms: that planning, resource allocation, or groundwork is underway. The system does not claim progress where none exists. It only acknowledges that responsibility has shifted.

This clarity matters. Contributors are not left wondering whether “execution” is real or rhetorical.

### Irreversibility and Accountability
Once a wish enters execution, it cannot silently revert. If execution stalls, fails, or changes direction, those outcomes must be reflected publicly. The system does not allow this phase to exist without trace.

This is where JanPulse deliberately limits its own flexibility in Favor of accountability.

### Outcome and Trust Effect
The flow ends with a subtle but powerful change in how contributors perceive the system. Until this point, JanPulse has been a place where intent is collected and prioritized. After this transition, it becomes a place where obligations are recorded.

Trust is reinforced because:

* responsibility is explicitly assigned
* transitions are visible and timestamped
* execution cannot occur off-record

At the end of this flow, users understand that collective intent, once strong enough, creates consequences. That understanding is what transforms participation into belief.

## 6. View Execution Progress & Proof

### Trigger
A user returns to a wish they have contributed to, or one they have been following. Time has passed. Money has accumulated. The wish has moved beyond intent. The user is no longer curious, they are expectant. They want to know whether anything has actually happened.

This moment is charged with scepticism.

### User Intent
The user wants confirmation that collective intent is being respected. They are not looking for celebration or marketing language. They are looking for evidence. Implicitly, they are asking: “Was my money taken seriously?”

### Entering the Execution State
On opening the wish, the user sees that its status has changed from “funded” to “in execution” (or equivalent). This change is visible and timestamped. The system makes it immediately clear that execution is not a vague promise, but a defined phase with responsibility attached.

No language suggests completion or success yet. Only progress.

### Accessing Execution Updates
The user scrolls to the execution section. Here, updates are presented as discrete entries rather than a narrative summary. Each update includes:

* what was done
* when it was done
* what remains

These updates are factual, restrained, and sequential. They resemble logs rather than announcements.

The system avoids emotional framing. There are no calls for patience, no justifications, no celebratory tone. The assumption is that transparency is sufficient.

### Viewing Proof
Where applicable, execution updates are accompanied by proof. This may include photographs, documents, measurements, or other verifiable artifacts. Proof is not presented as a gallery; it is contextual, tied directly to specific execution steps.

The user understands that these artifacts are not marketing assets. They exist to demonstrate that work occurred.

### Handling Incompleteness and Delay
If execution is incomplete, delayed, or encountering obstacles, this is shown explicitly. The system does not hide uncertainty. Instead, it exposes the current state and the reason for it, recorded as part of the execution history.

This is a critical moment. Most systems attempt reassurance here. JanPulse chooses honesty.

### Ledger Integration
Every execution update is reflected in the public ledger. The user can see when execution began, how funds were allocated, and when updates were posted. Nothing exists outside the ledger.

This reinforces the idea that execution is not an internal activity; it is a public obligation.

### Outcome and Trust Effect
The flow ends not with satisfaction, but with orientation. The user knows exactly what has happened, what is happening, and what has not yet happened.

Trust is reinforced not because the outcome is perfect, but because:

* progress is visible
* responsibility is explicit
* failure or delay is not concealed

At the end of this flow, the user understands something fundamental: JanPulse does not promise success. It promises accountability.

And that promise is being kept.

## 7. Wish Completion or Explicit Failure

### Trigger
A significant amount of time has passed since a wish entered execution. Contributors return not out of curiosity, but expectation. They are no longer asking whether the system is transparent. They are asking whether it is honest enough to close the loop.

This is the moment when outcomes matter more than process.

### System Intent
The system’s responsibility at this stage is not to perform success, but to record truth. Whether the wish is fulfilled or fails, JanPulse must make the outcome explicit, visible, and final.

Ambiguity is not acceptable here.

### Completion Path
If the wish has been fulfilled, its status changes to “completed.” This change is timestamped and written to the public ledger. The system presents a clear summary of what was done, what resources were used, and what outcome was achieved.

Completion is not framed as celebration. It is framed as closure. The language is factual and restrained, emphasizing what changed in the real world rather than how the system feels about it.

Supporting proof remains accessible and linked to the execution history. Contributors can trace the entire lifecycle of the wish from creation to outcome without gaps.

### Failure Path
If the wish cannot be fulfilled, the system does not leave it unresolved. Its status changes to “failed” or “closed without completion,” with the reason explicitly stated. This reason is not generalized or softened. It reflects the actual constraint encountered: insufficient funds, legal barriers, technical infeasibility, or unforeseen conditions.

This outcome is also recorded in the public ledger, with the same permanence as completion.

The system does not attempt to justify or excuse failure. It documents it.

### Visibility and Finality
In both paths, the system makes it clear that the wish has reached an endpoint. It is no longer accumulating funds, no longer progressing, and no longer ambiguous. Contributors are not left wondering whether something might still happen behind the scenes.

Finality is a feature here, not a limitation.

### Contributor Reflection
For contributors, this is a moment of evaluation. They assess not only the outcome, but the system’s behaviour. Did JanPulse hide discomfort? Did it avoid closure? Or did it tell the truth clearly?

Even in failure, clarity preserves dignity.

### Outcome and Trust Effect
The flow ends with a definitive state. The wish has either changed the world in a small, concrete way, or it has been honestly acknowledged as unfulfilled.

Trust is strengthened not because every wish succeeds, but because:

* outcomes are explicit
* failure is not buried
* history remains intact

At the end of this flow, contributors understand something rare: JanPulse does not exist to promise success. It exists to guarantee accountability.

That understanding is what turns participation into long-term belief.

## 8. Contributor Reflection (Implicit Flow)

### Trigger
The contributor reaches a moment of pause. It may happen after a wish is completed, after a failure is declared, or after observing execution progress over time. There is no notification prompting this flow. It occurs internally, in the user’s mind.

This is where experience turns into judgment.

### User Intent
The contributor is not trying to act. They are trying to decide. They are asking themselves a simple, personal question: “Was participating worth it?” More specifically, they are evaluating whether JanPulse treated their intent with respect.

This is not about satisfaction. It is about dignity.

### Recollection of the Journey
The contributor mentally retraces what happened:

* how easy it was to express their concern
* whether attaching money felt meaningful
* whether the system showed them what happened next
* whether progress or failure was communicated honestly

They do not remember every detail. They remember moments where trust was either reinforced or strained.

### Assessment of Fairness
The contributor considers whether the system behaved consistently:

* Were numbers visible and stable?
* Did outcomes match what was shown earlier?
* Did the platform avoid exaggeration or silence?

They are not expecting perfection. They are assessing fairness.

### Emotional Resolution
At this point, one of three internal states forms.

The contributor may feel validated: even if the wish failed, the system was honest, and their participation mattered.

They may feel neutral: nothing remarkable happened, but nothing felt wrong.

Or they may feel betrayed: information was missing, outcomes were unclear, or accountability felt weak.

This emotional resolution determines future behaviour.

### Behavioural Outcome
If the contributor feels validated, they are likely to return. They may create another wish, support an existing one, or simply continue observing. Participation becomes a habit.

If they feel neutral, they may disengage quietly, without resentment.

If they feel betrayed, they may never return and worse, they may discourage others.

The system cannot intervene here. This judgment happens beyond interface and messaging.

### System Responsibility
JanPulse does not attempt to optimize this reflection moment directly. It does not prompt testimonials or encourage feedback immediately. Instead, it relies on everything that came before: clarity, visibility, restraint, and honesty.

The system accepts that reflection cannot be controlled, only earned.

### Outcome and Trust Effect
This flow ends without action, but with consequence. The contributor’s internal verdict becomes part of the system’s long-term health.

Trust, once formed here, compounds quietly.

Trust, once broken here, does not return easily.

JanPulse succeeds not when contributors feel excited, but when they feel respected.
