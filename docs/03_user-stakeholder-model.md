# JanPulse: User & Stakeholder Model
JanPulse is designed as a system where collective public intent is converted directly into real-world action through a single accountable organization. Rather than outsourcing execution to many external parties, JanPulse itself takes responsibility for turning funded wishes into outcomes.

The system has three core roles.

The first role is the Contributor.

Contributors are individuals who create wishes and attach money to them. Their primary motivation is not donation, but representation. They want the issues that affect their lives, their communities, or their country to be acknowledged and acted upon. The ₹1 minimum contribution allows anyone to participate, while still requiring a conscious decision. Contributors risk being ignored or misled if the system fails. Their power lies in aggregation: individually small, but collectively decisive.

The second role is the Platform (JanPulse).

JanPulse is the interface and the rule-set through which all wishes and funds flow. It groups similar wishes, ranks them by total backing, routes money, and presents progress to the public. Its primary motivation is credibility. Without trust, participation collapses. JanPulse’s greatest risk is loss of legitimacy through perceived bias, opacity, or misuse of funds. Its power lies in visibility and structure: it determines what the public sees and how collective intent is interpreted.

The third role is the JanPulse Organization.

This is a single, private, non-profit execution body created specifically to act on funded wishes. It does not compete with contributors or the platform; it exists solely to transform collective priorities into real-world results. It hires planners, engineers, contractors, and specialists as needed to fulfil wishes. Its motivation is impact and long-term trust. Its risks include operational failure, misallocation of funds, and public scrutiny. Its power is practical: it controls how money is converted into action.

These three roles form a closed accountability loop.
* Contributors express priorities through money.
* JanPulse aggregates and publishes those priorities.
* The JanPulse Organization executes them.
* JanPulse reports progress and outcomes back to contributors.

Because execution is centralized within a single accountable body, responsibility is never diffused. If a wish fails, the failure is visible and attributable. If a wish succeeds, the credit is also visible. This clarity is essential for building trust in a system that asks people to fund public action directly.

JanPulse is therefore not a marketplace of causes or contractors. It is a citizen-funded execution engine, designed so that collective will, once expressed, has a direct and transparent path to reality.
