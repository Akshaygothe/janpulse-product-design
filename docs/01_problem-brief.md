# JanPulse — Problem Brief
India is more connected than ever before. Hundreds of millions of people express opinions daily through social media, messaging apps, protests, voting, and online petitions. Every street, every city, every community has issues that matter deeply to the people who live there, broken roads, unsafe crossings, polluted water, underfunded schools, stray animals, lack of healthcare, or neglected public spaces.

Yet despite this constant expression, most people feel unheard.

The systems that exist to represent public priorities operate on weak or distorted signals. Social media amplifies outrage and virality, not importance. A tweet with thousands of likes may reflect momentary emotion, not sustained collective will. Online petitions collect names but do not require commitment. Voting happens only once every few years and bundles hundreds of issues into a single choice. Government budgets and public spending are decided far away from the daily realities of neighbourhoods.

As a result, there is a growing disconnect between what people care about and what actually gets done.

At the same time, money remains one of the few signals that institutions consistently respect. Budgets, funding, and capital determine which projects get executed and which remain promises. However, money today is either controlled by the wealthy, filtered through complex bureaucracies, or mediated by large organizations that decide where funds should go. Ordinary citizens have very little direct influence over how collective resources are deployed.

This creates a structural gap: people have opinions, but they lack a credible, scalable way to express priorities in a form that leads to action.

Existing donation and crowdfunding platforms solve a different problem. They allow people to support predefined causes, usually chosen by organizations or campaign creators. They do not allow citizens to surface and prioritize the problems that matter most to them as a group. A neighbourhood cannot easily say, “This road matters more than everything else right now,” in a way that is both visible and financially meaningful.

What is missing is a system that transforms everyday concern into measurable, comparable public will.

The rise of UPI and zero-cost digital payments has quietly changed what is possible. For the first time, millions of people can send very small amounts of money instantly, at almost no cost. A single rupee is now as easy to send as a message. This creates an opportunity to use money not as a barrier, but as a signal.

A ₹1 contribution is small enough for anyone to afford, yet meaningful enough to require intent. Unlike a like or a comment, it carries a cost, however tiny. Those cost filters noise, making it a powerful indicator of what people genuinely care about.

The challenge is to design a system where even the smallest contribution can become a collective voice, where thousands or millions of ₹1 signals can surface what truly matters, and where pooled intent can lead to real-world action.

JanPulse exists to explore this gap.
