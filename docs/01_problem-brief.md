# JanPulse — Problem Brief
India is more connected than ever before. Hundreds of millions of people express opinions every day through social media, messaging apps, protests, voting, and online petitions. Every street, every city, every community carries problems that matter deeply to the people who live there, broken roads, unsafe crossings, polluted water, underfunded schools, stray animals, lack of healthcare, neglected public spaces.

Yet despite this constant expression, most people feel unheard.

The systems meant to represent public priorities rely on weak or distorted signals. Social media amplifies outrage and virality rather than importance. A tweet with thousands of likes reflects attention, not commitment. Online petitions collect names, not responsibility. Voting happens once every few years and compresses hundreds of issues into a single choice. Government budgets are decided far away from the daily realities of neighbourhoods.

As a result, there is a widening gap between what people care about and what actually gets done.

At the same time, money remains one of the few signals that institutions consistently respond to. Budgets, funding, and capital determine which problems receive action and which remain unresolved. But today, financial influence is concentrated, controlled by the wealthy, filtered through bureaucracies, or mediated by large organizations that choose where resources go. Ordinary citizens have very little direct way to influence how collective resources are deployed.

This creates a structural imbalance. People have opinions, frustrations, and needs, but they lack a credible, continuous, and scalable way to express priorities in a form that leads to real action.

Existing donation and crowdfunding platforms do not solve this gap. They allow people to support predefined causes created by organizations or campaign owners, but they do not allow communities to surface and prioritize their own problems. A neighbourhood cannot easily say, “This road matters more than anything else right now,” in a way that is both visible and financially meaningful.

What is missing is not more conversation, but a way to turn everyday concern into measurable, comparable public will.

The rise of UPI and zero-cost digital payments has quietly changed what is possible. For the first time, millions of people can send very small amounts of money instantly and without friction. A single rupee is now as easy to transfer as a message. This makes it possible to use money not as a barrier, but as a signal.

A ₹1 contribution is small enough for almost anyone to afford, yet meaningful enough to require intent. Unlike a like or a comment, it carries a cost, however tiny. Those cost filters noise, leaving behind what people are willing to stand behind.

The challenge, then, is to imagine a system where even the smallest financial signal can become a collective voice, where thousands or millions of ₹1 decisions reveal what truly matters, and where pooled intent can be translated into visible, real-world outcomes.

JanPulse exists as a way to explore this gap.
